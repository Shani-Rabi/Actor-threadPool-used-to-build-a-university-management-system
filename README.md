# Actor-threadPool-used-to-build-a-university-management-system
In Actor thread pool, each actor has a queue of actions. One can submit new actions for actors and the pool makes sure that each actor will run its actions in the order they were received, while not blocking other threads. The threads in the pool are assigned dynamically to the actors.
