# Actor-threadPool-used-to-build-a-university-management-system
In Actor thread pool, each actor has a queue of actions. One can submit new actions for actors and the pool makes sure that each actor will run its actions in the order they were received, while not blocking other threads. The threads in the pool are assigned dynamically to the actors.

The university has a set of departments, each department offers a set of courses to students
(of all the departments) and each student can register for courses if he meets the prerequisites and there is
an available space for him.
This project enable the university to open courses, register students and etc.
